title: 'Rendering Markdown table in NextJS mdx'
publishedAt: '2024-09-08'
summary: This blog post talks about the issues of next js not rendering MDX table properly and ways to resolve it
---

To have a blog site that uses MDX file format to render blog post, Utilizing `NextJS` propably the easiest way for most users. `Vercel` provides the Portfolio template to easily get starterd with the whole blog system. You can get [Portfolio Starter Kit here](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit).

Rendering Table via markdown is not a `Common Mark feature` but a `Github Flavoured Markdown` Extension. All the Extension of the Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) can be found [here](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-) 

NextJS uses `next-mdx-remote` for MD and MDX data parsing and rendering. For this Blog it is using `next@14.2.x` with `next-mdx-remote@4.4.x`.
To render Tables we need to use `remark-gfm` in the project and use it as optional plugin in for `next-mdx-remote`.

This is how we stup the `remark-gfm`

- Install `remark-gfm` using `pnmp` or `npm`. For Portfolio Starter Kit pnpm is recommended by Vercel.
```bash
// type this in tertminal
pnpm add remark-gfm
``` 

- In your `mdx.tsx` file define a constant variable like this 
```tsx
// mdx.tsx
const options = {
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [],
  },
};
```
- We will pass this variable as the options for `<MDXRemote>` component. Like the source code below

```tsx
// mdx.tsx
export function CustomMDX(props) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      {...props}
      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}
      options={options} // Addition
    />
  );
}
```
## Issue: 
Even though the setup is correct we get an error of this type. This case the applicatoin doesnot render at all.

```text
// github issue : https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/issues/403#issuecomment-1743827064
error {
  name: 'Error',
  source: 'server',
  message: '[next-mdx-remote] error compiling MDX:\n' +
    "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'inTable')\n" +
    '\n' +
    'More information: https://mdxjs.com/docs/troubleshooting-mdx',
  stack: '',
  digest: '199367153'
}
```
## Resolve :
To resolve the issue we can use this Github Issue as firststep. This assures that downgreading `remark-gfm` 3.x does work with nextJS.
As mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/issues/403#issuecomment-1829304863)

And it does work ! Here is the proof !

|remarkGfm version| Does table render?|
|---|---|
|4.x|No|
|3.x|Yes|
